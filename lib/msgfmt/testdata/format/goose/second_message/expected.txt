Hi! I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm Goose, Block's AI assistant, and I
'm ready to help you with various tasks - whether that's working with code, runn
ing commands, or handling other technical tasks using my available tools.       
                                                                                
I notice we're currently in `/Users/hugodutka/dev/openagent`, and I have access 
to developer tools that let me help with file operations, shell commands, and ev
en screen captures if needed.                                                   
                                                                                
Is there anything specific you'd like assistance with? I'm happy to:            
- Help with code or development tasks                                           
- Run shell commands or file operations                                         
- Explain my capabilities in more detail                                        
- Or assist with any other tasks you have in mind                               
                                                                                
Just let me know what you'd like to work on!
